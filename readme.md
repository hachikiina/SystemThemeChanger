# System Theme Changer
This is a really basic application I put together in 2 hours.  
If you find any bugs, you can let me know by opening a issue or a pr.  

## Usage
This program doesn't have any interfaces other than the tray icon and the context menu of the icon.  
You can directly left click the icon to switch to other theme.  
You can also right click the icon and choose the theme you want or close the application.  

## On startup
You can just put the whole executable file in the startup folder.

## License
There aren't any licenses currently. If there were to be one, it would be [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/).
